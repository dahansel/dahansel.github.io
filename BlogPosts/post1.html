				<h3 class="text-green pl-2">Planning</h3>
				<p class="bg-dark">
					Planning should be the first step of any project. When making a blueprint for a building, architects
					must answer several questions such as "How many square feet will the building be?" "What materials
					do we buy, and how much?" "Is this building structure possible, or will it need to be changed to
					comply to regulations?" ...And many others. As such, game developers have their own set of questions to
					answer. The exact questions depend on the nature of the game, but there are some common ones that have
					to do with whether the game will be a viable product. Questions asked are more specific than "Is it fun?"
					In fact, if it's a digital game, the paper prototype might look almost nothing like the final product.
					Due to limitations of paper, real-time games may be represented as turn-based and answer questions
					pertaining to level design and base mechanics. Having all these questions answered will make everything
					going forward much easier.

				<h3 class="text-blue pl-2">Iterating</h3>
				<p class="bg-dark">
					Thanks to the disposability of paper, you can iterate quickly and with less setup time compared to how long it takes to make a computer do something.
					But most importantly, because there's less investment, it makes the designers less resistant to change and less
					invested in it. After all, the whole point of the paper prototype is to find problems that go beyond a mere
					bug or glitch- it's where to find problems with the core game itself. Iteration is fixing these problems and trying
					out new, bolder things. For example, with my game I decided to add an "AI" enemy that patrolled a path,
					even though it's a multiplayer game. Testing showed that the addition of it was pretty satisfying and
					put more risk into the game, so now I can think about how to implement it digitally, whereas if I started
					digital I might not have even considered AI because of the effort it would have taken.

				<h3 class="text-red pl-2">Failing</h3>
				<p class="bg-dark">
					Maybe your project didn't work out. Maybe people just don't have fun with it, or perhaps you came across
					a question you can't answer. When these things happen and just can't be avoided, it's probably time to axe the project.
					But as strange as it may seem, failure can be a good thing! For one, it's good for investors and companies
					to know a project won't work out before they pour in millions of dollars and dozens of hours into a
					project. It's also good for the developers, however, because if one method fails, there may be another
					method that works even better than the first. In addition, failure needs to happen at some point before
					one can improve. It's best to fail as soon as possible so you can get back up and try something new.

				<p class="bg-dark pt-1">
					Paper prototypes are a great thing. They're one of the most useful things to do in early stages of development
					to save as much precious time, money and headache as you can. Being a game developer means coming to terms
					with the fact that not all of your ideas will see the light of day, let alone be good ones. But behind every
					good idea is a hundred bad ones. As the saying goes, the difference between the master and the novice
					is that the master has failed more than the novice has tried.
