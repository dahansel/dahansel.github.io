	        <h3 class="text-green">Planning</h3>
	        <p class="bg-dark">
	            Planning should be the first step of any project. When making a blueprint for a building, architects
				must answer several questions such as "How many square feet will the building be?" "What materials
				do we buy, and how much?" "Is this building structure possible, or will it need to be changed to
				comply to regulations?" ...And many others. As such, game developers have their own set of questions to
				answer. The exact questions depend on the nature of the game, but there are some common ones that have
				to do with whether the game will be a viable product. Questions asked are more specific than "Is it fun?"
				In fact, if it's a digital game, the paper prototype might look almost nothing like the final product.
				Due to limitations of paper, real-time games may be represented as turn-based and answer questions
				pertaining to level design and base mechanics. Having all these questions answered will make everything
				going forward much easier.

	        <h3 class="text-blue">Iterating</h3>
	        <p class="bg-dark">
				Thanks to the disposability of paper, you can iterate quickly and with less setup time compared to how long it takes to make a computer do something.
				But most importantly, because there's less investment, it makes the designers less resistant to change and less
				invested in it. After all, the whole point of the paper prototype is to find problems that go beyond a mere
				bug or glitch- it's where to find problems with the core game itself. Iteration is fixing these problems and trying
				out new, bolder things. For example, with my game I decided to add an "AI" enemy that patrolled a path,
				even though it's a multiplayer game. Testing showed that the addition of it was pretty satisfying and
				put more risk into the game, so now I can think about how to implement it digitally, whereas if I started
				digital I might not have even considered AI because of the effort it would have taken.

	        <h3 class="text-red">Failing</h3>
	        <p class="bg-dark">
	            Maybe your project didn't work out. Maybe people just don't have fun with it, or perhaps you came across
				a question you can't answer. When these things happen and just can't be avoided, it's probably time to axe the project.
				But as strange as it may seem, failure can be a good thing! For one, it's good for investors and companies
				to know a project won't work out before they pour in millions of dollars and dozens of hours into a
				project. It's also good for the developers, however, because if one method fails, there may be another
				method that works even better than the first. In addition, failure needs to happen at some point before
				one can improve. It's best to fail as soon as possible so you can get back up and try something new.

	        <p class="bg-dark">
	             Paper prototypes are a great thing. They're one of the most useful things to do in early stages of development
				to save as much precious time, money and headache as you can. Being a game developer means coming to terms
				with the fact that not all of your ideas will see the light of day, let alone be good ones. But behind every
				good idea is a hundred bad ones. As the saying goes, the difference between the master and the novice
				is that the master has failed more than the novice has tried.
