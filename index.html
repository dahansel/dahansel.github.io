				<h3>Topic 1- Paper, Please</h3>
				<small>Posted by David Hansel on 1/23/20</small>
				<p>Prototyping is one of the most important aspects because it's where you find how viable your idea is
				to make reality. Generally, paper prototypes are used in the first step because it's much easier-
				you can iterate quickly and it takes less setup because of how long it takes to make a computer do something.
				But most importantly, because there's less investment, it makes the designers less resistant to change and less
				invested in it. After all, the whole point of the paper prototype is to find problems that go beyond a mere
				bug or glitch- it's where to find problems with the core game itself. Iteration is fixing these problems and trying
				out new, bolder things. For example, with my game I decided to add an "AI" enemy that patrolled a path,
				even though it's a multiplayer game. Testing showed that the addition of it was pretty satisfying and
				put more risk into the game, so now I can think about how to implement it digitally, whereas if I started
				digital I might not have even considered AI because of the effort it would have taken.</p>
